Guidelines for projects:

General:
- All projects should be hosted on github/gitlab or similars.

- Each student performs commits using his own account.

- We want to see the individual commits.

- Projects will be subject to anti plagiarism check and memory check (valgrind) when applicable

- You can use/reuse all the code presented at lesson and in the repo.

- You are allowed to ask stack overflow (or similar) how to solve specific problems

- The projects are (mostly) individual.

  Special projects (to be discussed with the teachers) might be done in groups.
  The complecity of a group project will be roughly  proportional to the number
  of components.
  In this case, the contribution of each member in the group to the development
  should be made clear.  Comment your sections in the source with some
  initials or nickname

Linux Projects
   
L2. File System FAT .
   Implement a file system that uses a pseudo "FAT" on an mmapped buffer.
   The functions to implement are

   createFile
   eraseFile
   write (potentially extending the file boundaries)
   read
   seek
   createDir
   eraseDir
   changeDir
   listDir

   The opening of a file should return a "FileHandle" that stores the position in a file.
